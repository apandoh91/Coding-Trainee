# Coding-Trainee

I have some knowledge of programming, but I am learning more and enhancing my skills. This repository will searve as a way to make the learning stage a little more interactive and collaborative.

I have general knowlege of HTML and CSS, so those will what I will use most. Any comments or suggestions of great places that I can use to help me learn would be great! I currently use w3schools.org to help me with what I need.
